# RPSGame
Rock Paper Scissors

## Game Description
RPSGame is a simple two-player implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Players take turns choosing one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game determines the winner based on the following rules:

- **Rock beats Scissors** (Rock crushes Scissors)
- **Scissors beats Paper** (Scissors cut Paper)
- **Paper beats Rock** (Paper covers Rock)

The game is played over three rounds, and the player with the most wins at the end of the rounds is declared the overall winner. If both players win the same number of rounds, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Play
1. Each player selects their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for each round.
2. The game compares the choices and determines the winner of the round.
3. After three rounds, the game announces the overall winner or declares a tie.
