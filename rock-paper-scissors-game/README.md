# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game for two players. Players can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

## How to Play
1. Each player selects one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The choices are compared to determine the winner:
   - If both players choose the same option, the game is a draw.
   - If one player's choice beats the other's, that player wins.
